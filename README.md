#Install

Run: `npm install -g angular-cli`.

After installation, Angular CLI will be available using the `ng` command.

#Generate New Project

Run: `ng new <projectname>`

A directory named after your <projectname> will be created.  There are no prompts when creating a new project.  Instead, the project is scaffolded using sensible defaults.

#Run Locally

New projects can be immediately ran locally without any further setup.

For local deployment, run: `ng serve`

The CLI will utilize webpack to transpile (TS->JS) and compile your source files and static assets.

Open from your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.
